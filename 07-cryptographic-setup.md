# 07. Cryptographic Setup

## Overview

This RFC specifies the cryptographic primitives used to transfer secrets through transactions with adaptor signatures and specifies the cryptographic setup required at the beginning of a swap to guarantee funds safety and recovery. Key, signature and proof formats are dependent on the blockchain and the type of cryptography used, see [08. Transactions](./08-transactions.md) for more examples with Bitcoin.

## Cryptographic Keys

We describe the cryptographic keys needed by both swap roles defined in [01. High Level Overview](./01-high-level-overview.md).

A `private_key` type and a `public_key` type is defined for the arbitrating blockchain for each cryptographic approach and for the accordant blockchain.

For each public key described in the following section, we assume knowledge of the corresponding private key.

**Arbitrating example:** For Bitcoin ECDSA the `public_key` is an ECDSA `secp256k1` public key. For Bitcoin Schnorr the `public_key` is a Schnorr `secp256k1` public key.

**Accordant example:** for Monero the `public_key` is an `ed25519` public key.

### Accordant seller

Keys generated by the accordant seller role at the beginning of the swap phase:

```
Ab: arbitrating buy public_key;
Ac: arbitrating cancel public_key;
Ar: arbitrating refund public_key;
Ap: arbitrating punish public_key;

Ta: arbitrating adaptor public_key;

K_s^a: accordant spend public_key;
K_v^a: accordant view public_key;

where
    Ta = K_s^a projection over the arbitrating group
```

### Arbitrating seller

Keys generated by the arbitrating seller role at the beginning of the swap phase:

```
Bf: arbitrating fund public_key;
Bb: arbitrating buy public_key;
Bc: arbitrating cancel public_key;
Br: arbitrating refund public_key;

Tb: arbitrating adaptor public_key;

K_s^b: accordant spend public_key;
K_v^b: accordant view public_key;

where
    Tb = K_s^b projection over the arbitrating group
```

### Signatures

We define a `signature` type for the arbitrating blockchain role related to the `private_key`/`public_key` types defined previously.

**Arbitrating example:** for Bitcoin ECDSA the `signature` is an ECDSA signature, and for Bitcoin Schnorr, the `signature` is a Schnorr signature following [[2] BIP 0340: Schnorr Signatures for secp256k1](#references).

The interface for interacting with arbitrating signatures is composed of three functions:

 * `Gen`: A key generation algorithm, this function must follow the rules of the chosen `private_key` type.

 * `Sign`: An algorithm that signs a given message as defined in the chosen signing primitive, e.g. ECDSA, Schnorr, etc.

 * `Vrfy`: Verify a signature based on public parameters. If validation passes, the signature is a valid signature.

## Adaptor Signatures

We define an `adaptor_signature` type for the arbitrating blockchain related to the `private_key`/`public_key` types defined previously.

An adaptor signature scheme extends a standard signature (`Gen`, `Sign`, `Vrfy`) scheme with:

 * `EncGen`: An encryption key generation algorithm, in this protocol the encryption key generation is linked to the cross-group DLEQ proof.

 * `EncSig`: Encrypt a signature and return an adaptor signature. This RFC uses the public key tweaking method, see [[3] Adaptor signature -Schnorr signature and ECDSA-](#references) section *3. Adaptor Signatures* for examples.

 * `EncVrfy`: Verify an adaptor signature based on public parameters, if validation passes the decrypted adaptor signature is a valid signature.

 * `DecSig`: Decrypt an adaptor signature by injecting the encryption key.

 * `RecKey`: Recover the key material needed for extracting the encryption key with `Rec`.

 * `Rec`: Recover the encryption key based on the adaptor signature and the decrypted signature.

We describe an adaptor signature interface and two instantiations, one for ECDSA inside Bitcoin scripts and one for Schnorr inside Taproot scripts.

### ECDSA Scripts

 * `EncSig`:

```
 pi = PDLEQ( (G, R'), (T, R), k )
 s' = k^-1 ⋅ ( hash(m) + f(R)d )

 return (R, R', s', pi)

where
    f(): x-coordinate mod q
    P = dG
    R = kT
    R' = kG
```

`PDLEQ` produces a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge of the same relation `k` between two pairs of elements in the same group, i.e. `(G, R')` and `(T, R)`.

The `adaptor_signature` type is define as `(R, R', s', pi)` for this instantiation.

 * `EncVrfy`:

```
 VDLEQ( (G, R'), (T, R), pi ) =? 1

 R' =? ( H(m)G ⋅ f(R)P )^{s'^-1}

where
    f(): x-coordinate mod q
    P = dG
    R = kT
    R' = kG
```

`VDLEQ` verifies a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge of the same unknown relation `x` between two pairs of elements in the same group.

 * `DecSig`:

```
 s = s't^-1
   = k^-1 ⋅ ( hash(m) + f(R)d ) ⋅ t^-1

 return (f(R), s)

where
    f(): x-coordinate mod q
    P = dG
    R = kT
    R' = kG
```

 * `RecKey`:

Convenience function for making ECDSA and Schnorr APIs consistent.
```
return (T, s')
```

 * `Rec`:

```
 t' = s^-1 ⋅ s'

     ┌  s' if s'G = T
 t = ├ -s' if s'G = T^-1
     └  NaN otherwise
```

 * `Vrfy`: as defined in [[5] BIP 0143: Transaction Signature Verification for Version 0 Witness Program](#references)

### Taproot Schnorr Scripts

This notation follows BIP 340, with some simplication on even y coordinate check for private keys:

 * `EncSig`:

```
 s' = k + tagged_hash( bytes(R + T) || bytes(P) || m )d
```

The `adaptor_signature` type is defined as `(R, s')` for this instantiation.

 * `EncVrfy`:

```
 s'G =? R + tagged_hash( bytes(R + T) || bytes(P) || m )P

where
    P = dG
```

 * `DecSig`:

```
 s = s' + t
   = k + t + tagged_hash( bytes(R + T) || bytes(P) || m )d

where
    P = dG
    R = kG
    T = tG
```

 * `RecKey`:

Convenience function for making ECDSA and Schnorr APIs consistent.
```
return s'
```

 * `Rec`:

```
 t = s - s'
```

 * `Vrfy`: as defined in [[2] BIP 0340: Schnorr Signatures for secp256k1](#references)

```
 sG =? R + tagged_hash( bytes(R) || bytes(P) || m )P
```

## Cross-group Discrete Logarithm Proof

We define a `cross_group_proof` type for the Arbitrating-Accordant blockchain pair dependent on the `private_key` groups. If the groups are the same, the proof is set to null.

A cross-group Discrete Logarithm proving system is defined with:

 * `XDLGen`: An algorithm that generates the parameters based on the given security level.

 * `XDLProve`: An algorithm that produces a proof in zero-knowledge of a relation `x` for the tuple `(xG', xH')` where `G` and `H` are prime-order groups where the discrete logarithm problem is assumed to be hard and `G' ∈ G` and `H' ∈ H`, among other proof elements.

 * `XDLVrfy`: Verify the proof for a given relation `(xG', xH')`.

An example instantiation of this system is described in [[4] Discrete logarithm equality across groups](#references).
